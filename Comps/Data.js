For the detection phase, I used Resnet-50 for detecting the keypoints in a tennis court. I used YOLOv5 model to train and predict the ball positions in each frmae of the video. This project also involved some complex calculations and manipulations based on logics, to solve some challenges. The code for the project can be found here: "
