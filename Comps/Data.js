const Text_1 = "I built a tennis analysis system that can detect the participating players in a tennis match, detect the tennis ball, which is being used to play the game, calculate the shot speed and the player speed of each player in the video. To get the frames of the video, I used video capturing method to capture the frames and used those frames to detect features. For the detection phase, I used Resnet-50 for detecting the keypoints in a tennis court. I used YOLOv5 model to train and predict the ball positions in each frmae of the video. This project also involved some complex calculations and manipulations based on logics, to solve some challenges. Mostly, to calculate the player stats in the video. The code for the project can be found below: "
